        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Role-playing-games like final fantasy are my favorites because I always love a good story.
            I also love the sense of progression that comes with growing your characters through levels
            and experience. If any video game have a great soundtrack, then it helps me to remember
            that video game long after I finish playing it. Story, music, and progression are what I look for 
            most in a video game.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Music has always been my most preferred method of relaxing. If I can find a great soundtrack to a 
            video game, I can listen for hours while I study. If I find a great playlist of songs, I can lose 
            myself in the moment and appreciate the music. Lyrics also really matter to me in any song because
            impactful lyrics transform music into something more meaningful. Video game music and music from
            the 80s are some of my favorites.

        <h2>Films</h2>
        <p>For me, a film must have a great score. I'm the type of person who watches a film, or plays a video
            game, or listens to a song over an over again if I really like it and if a film has a great soundtrack,
            it will keep me coming back. Star Wars episode IV, Bladerunner, and Anchorman are some of my
            favorite films.
